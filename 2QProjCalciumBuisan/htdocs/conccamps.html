		<h2>What are Concentration Camps?</h2>
		
		<article>
		<p>According to Britannica, a concentration camp is an internment centre for political prisoners and members of national or minority groups who are confined for reasons of state security, exploitation, or punishment, usually by executive decree or military order. Concentration camps were made to confine people that the state considered as threats or danger.</p>
		<p>Concentration camps have dated back to as early as 1933, when the Nazi officials used these camps as a site for political prisoners. In other sites, some have claimed the first concentration camps to be during the Boer War by the British. But for the majority, the most well known concentration camps were in Germany, or more specifically, the Nazi.</p>
		<p>On another hand, the earliest sightings of the China concentration camps are in Xinjiang, where they term these camps as "re-education camps". Whilst the defined goal of these camps is to re-educate the confined, many leaked videos and photographs state otherwise.</p>
