		<h1>Muslims in China</h1>
	
		<h2>Who are the Uyghurs?</h2>
		<article>
		
			<p>The Uyghurs or the Uighurs are composed mostly of a Muslim Turkic ethnicity. They regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The majority of these Uyghurs reside in Xinjiang- an autonomous territory in Northwest China, where they number about 11 million people.</p>
	
			<p>The Uighurs are mainly a sedentary village-dwelling people who live in the network of oases formed in the valleys and lower slopes of the Tien Shan, Pamirs, and related mountain systems. The region is one of the most arid in the world; hence, for centuries they have practiced irrigation to conserve their water supply for agriculture. Their principal food crops are wheat, corn (maize), kaoliang (a form of sorghum), and melons. The chief industrial crop is cotton, which has long been grown in the area. Many Uighurs are employed in petroleum extraction, mining, and manufacturing in urban centres. <span>(Britannica, n.d.)</span> The Uyghurs are one of the many other persecuted Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. These include the Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz and Hui.</p>
	
			<p>Other Uyghur communities are also located in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. Another several thousand of them also live in Australia. The Uyghurs, like any other, also have their own language called Uighur. But many accusations are pointed to China as they are apparently forcing the Ughurs taken in Xinjiang's camps to learn Mandarin- China's language.</p>
	
			<p>China’s President Xi Jinping has overseen a hardline approach towards Muslim minorities living in Xinjiang, especially the Uyghurs. For the past several years, China's official have detained and taken millions of Uyghur Muslims to a concentration camp that they state is for the purpose of 're-educating' these Muslims. But evidences of human rights violations, death in custody, and forced labour are steadily growing through the years.</p>

		<h2>Why the Uyghurs?</h2>
		
		<article>
			<p>The People’s Republic of China annexed Xinjiang in 1949. At this time, the Uyghurs numbered around 76% of the region’s population. While Han Chinese – the country’s majority ethnic group – accounted for just 6.2%. This drastically changed over the years because today, the official statistics show that the Uyghurs, once 76%, are now only 42%, while the Han now comprises 40% of Xinjiang.</p>
			
			<p>Since then, Muslim minorities and segments of the population refuse Beijing's rule. Many of these minorities refuse to speak Mandarin, while others are campaigning for independence from Beijing. But Beijing regards any type of discontent or criticism from the people as threatening. The minority's dissent is considered as harmful or dangerous to the state security. Even those who voice out their concern for improvements in health, education, and employment are posed as dangers to the state. Beijing holds its territorial integrity with high regard. They do not tolerate expressions contrary to Xinjiang's official position as part of China.</p>
			
			<p>This is ultimately why the concentration camps in the Xinjiang province were created and put up. China defines these camps as vocational skills training centers - centers to rehabilitate and 'correct' the Uyghur Muslim Minorities.
			<span>But do these concentration camps actually impose these humane rules as China says they do?</span></p>
