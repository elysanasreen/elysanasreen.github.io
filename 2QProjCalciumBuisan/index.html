		<p>The situation of the Uyghur Muslims in China's concentration camps is as serious as it gets. These concentration camps have been up and running since the early 2017. Three years have passed, but how big of a change was made? How many people have tried to help these Uyghur Muslims? Has the government made any move to stop these camps? What is actually happening behind the walls of camps that they state is for the purpose of countering "extremism" and "terrorism"? </p>
		<p>Today is the perfect time for you to open your eyes and be informed of the truth behind these camps. Help the Uyghur Muslims. Be it through small, or big, noticeable ways.</p>
