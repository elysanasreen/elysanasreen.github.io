		<h2>What's happening to the Uyghurs?</h2>
		
		<article>
		<p>The latest news state that the China officials have been teaming up and making plans for a long while now to expand the detention camps in Xinjiang for the purpose of supressing these Uyghur Muslim minorities. The Uyghurs have already had their own independent nations in two separate times in the past century. Even in the past, the Uyghur's already had their own culture and traditions which were more related to the Kyrgyzstan and the Uzbekistan than the Han Chinese.
		They had different languages, styles, music, beliefs, and a rich history unique to them that separated them from the Han Chinese.</p>
		
		<p>China finds the Xinjiang as an important territory because of its rich energy resources. To this day, Xinjiang accounts for about 40% of China's coal reserves, 20% of their oil and gas, and 20% of their potential for wind energy.
		And these resources that lie in Xinjiang, this geographical location of Xinjiang - is what China needs most. But as we may or may not know, here in the territory of Xinjiang is where the Uyghurs live, where their rightful homes are.
		Unfortunately, China, which needs the resources in Xinjiang, demands and desires for full and stable control of the area. 
		Thus, as early as the 1950s, China tried finding ways to weaken the Uyghurs' possible influence. 
		One of the ways they did so is by encouraging the Han Chinese to move and migrate to Xinjiang. The Chinese rejoiced in success as the previously 82.7% of Uyghurs in Xinjiang turned to now only 46.1% in 50-years time. <p>

		<p> This continued on and on while the Uyghurs continously decreased in size and were steadily being left behind economically. Until in 2009, not able to take such treatment, the Uyghurs protested, rebellions and riots broke out. 
		The Han Chinese highly dominating the area won to the Uyghurs and in the end, more than hundreds were injured and even killed. 
		In 2013, Xinjiang became even more important to the Chinese because of their steadily growing economic and political influence. 
		By then, Xinjiang became the most important corridor wherein most exports, imports, and trading underwent. 
		This was the reason why China wanted to ensure that Xinjiang was safe and secure. But for the Uyghurs, this was a major setback. The Uyghurs were perceived as threats- extremist and even separatist threats.
		China began to impose "de-extrimification policies" to hold back the supposedely "dangerous" Uyghurs. Some policies were as absurd as them having to cut off their beards, take out their phones, and QR codes to ensure that they aren't possible rebels. 
		<span>But the major and probably the most brutal "policy" that the Chinese imposed to the innocent Uyghur muslim minorites, were the concentration camps.</span></p>
